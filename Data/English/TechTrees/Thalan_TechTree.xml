			<Details>Artificial Gravity is a technology that is the direct result of having immense amounts of energy at hand.  The applications of artificial gravity are both obvious and subtle.||The obvious application is that ships can now travel for extended periods through space with native gravity levels without compromising the ship design with fragile and unreliable physical motion devices (i.e. ships do not have to spin their hulls to maintain gravity).||The historical fleets of the Drengin Empire and the Arcean Empire in the pre-artificial gravity era are very obvious. Their hulls spin on a super conducting pivot powered by regulated micro bursts of thrust to keep the spinning consistent.  Needless to say, these ships would not be reliable in battle.||The Drengin fleet that conquered the Torian home world in the pre-hyperdrive era were all without artificial gravity and relied on a stargate that still resulted in a travel time of nearly a year.  Two of the troop carriers in that journey had a malfunction in their rotational axis control during the journey resulting in having over 25,000 Drengin shock troops having to live out their remaining lives in space. ||Fortunately, the lives of those Drengin shock troops was short since they were soon converted into fuel.  Another key use is that it can be used to channel gravity on planets which allows for more serious planetary improvements.</Details>

			<Description>Alows construction of ships designed for interstellar travel.</Description>
			<Details>The ability to design containers that are required to travel immense distances and survive extended periods of time in the vacuum of space is no trivial task.||Prior to space travel, civilizations with a lively tradition of science fiction tended to downplay or completely ignore what precisely was involved in producing things that travel from star to star.||Space, as is well known, is big.  It's mind boggling big.  But it is not nearly as empty as people believe. As early space explorers learned, often the hard way, traveling even between planets is hazardous.||Many early engineers focused almost totally on the propulsion of a ship rather than the actual construction of a ship.  To many engineers, space travel was essentially putting either robots or organic travelers into a metal box and attaching propulsion.  Not so at all.||First, these metal tubes in the vacuum of space are subjected to radiations that could scarcely be imagined by terrestrial scientists.  Secondly, once outside the gravity well of a planet system, the metal tubes were routinely subjected to micro meteorites.   Flecks of asteroids or bits of metal flying through space at hundreds of meters per second.  ||The intersection of a space ship and flecks of high speed metal resulted in the shredding of said space ship.||Interstellar construction is a technology that allows for the construction of better, more efficient, and more durable star ships.</Details>

			<Details>Duralthene armor is our prototype attempt to create a type of armor making use of a new element called Adamantium. Adamantium doesn't exist naturally. Rather, it is a derivative of an extremely rare element found occasionally in asteroids that have been recently struck by large comets.||Adamantium is the result of taking that rare material and subjecting it to an intense energy field. The result is a material that actually isn't completely in-sync with normal space. Duralthene armor is essentially taking the old Tri-Strontium alloy and coating it with trace amounts of this Adamantium material.||When a mass driver comes into contact with the Adamantium, the material of the mass driver is dissipated into the sub-dimensions of the Adamantium. It's difficult to explain but most of the mass is instantly moved out of our normal space and into a slightly out of sync dimension. The remaining material of the mass driver weapon is then absorbed through the traditional Tri-Strontium alloy.</Details>

The Apocalypse that originates in this space-time in their near future does not reach our space-time for a considerable amount of time. As a result, we have developed energy sources that are far beyond anything that is present here.||Unfortunately, the Hyperion Matrix we brought with us, the source of our advanced technology, is all based on what would be called "Expert Gravitronics".

As a result, we have to make use of portable fusion reactors that we buy on the open market or manufacture ourselves.||Stellar Production is the adaptation of our tools for technological and manufacturing production to use fusion reactors as opposed to Gravitronic Reactors.

			<Description>Background of the Thalan</Description>
			<Details>Our universe exists in 11 dimensions. There are also a near-infinite number of universes that are connected to each of those 11 dimensions. Destroying a universe is a non-trivial effort.  And yet, somehow, the primitive species of this space time have managed to do just that. Specifically, the species known as humans, in their near-future, manage to create such utter destruction that the resulting ruin feeds upon itself and permeates all of creation throughout every dimension.||The only bright side to this is that this destruction travels at the speed of light. The downside is that the destruction moves at the speed of light through folded space which means it will engulf the universe in far less than the 13 billion of their years that it would otherwise require.||We have thus brought a single strike force through dimension 4 to this particular universe in the hopes of averting this apocalypse. Thus far, the humans do not seem to be the type to unleash the kind of destruction that they apparently destined to do. But they are not what they seem to be either.  The humans in their government, the Terran Alliance, attempt to provide a diplomatic, peaceful coexistent front-end to their activities. They genuinely seem to be interested in living in peace.||And yet, these same peaceful humans are incredibly ruthless when motivated.  For example, we have learned that only 10 years (human years) ago, the humans wiped out a civilization known as the Xendar. The humans fight what they call "total wars" which is in contrast to the skirmishes that other civilizations seem to fight.  That is, humans seem to resist war to a point but once a threshold has been passed, the humans fight to win for all time.||In the current time, the galaxy is beset by an immense war with multiple factions. The most powerful faction is called the Drengin Empire. They are a ruthless, evil civilization whose motivation is control and conquest.  Their brethren, the Korath, are xenophobic and wish to wipe out all non-Drengin life.  The two are struggling for control.  The Korath are quite obviously being manipulated by the remnants of a the malevolent Arnor civilization called "Dread Lords" who lack the numbers to conquer the galaxy through open arms but are potent enough to use pawns to accomplish their ends.||At the same time, the main human fleet has disappeared to where we do not know. But not before leaving Earth protected by an Arnorian shield that nothing can penetrate leaving the Drengin frustrated in their attempts to final victory over the Terran Alliance.  The Terran Alliance still has a handful of task forces in the galaxy who are quite capable of being every bit as brutal as the Drengin when necessary.||And then there are the other civilizations who have chosen sides.  Our concern is with the humans.  Our goal is to build up enough of a force so that when we identify the cause of the ruin, we can act.|</Details>

			<Description>Key energy and matter technology</Description>
			<Details>Gravitrons are the elementary particle of the universe. The universe exists in 11 dimensions. Some of the civilizations have a basic understanding of what they call "String Theory". In String theory, all matter is produced based on different frequencies of sub-atomic particles called strings.  What they do not yet understand is that these strings all rest on an arbitrary edge of an even more elementary particle called a Gravitron.  While they are correct that vibrating strings create all matter and energy, they do not yet realize that these strings are not arbitrarily positioned. The gravitron is 11-sided -- one for each dimension of the universe and each edge has its own strings.  Beings of a given dimension can only perceive a limited number of these edges (beings in the third dimension can perceive 3 sides but do not realize that all strings they are aware of are directed in one of three predictable angles because they cannot perceive the other 8 angles).||Gravitronics matters because once gravitrons (not to be confused with gravitons) can be harnessed, any conventional power system can be easily enhanced to produce 2^8th more power than it would normally produce. ||Basic Gravitronics is about as far as we can get in this space-time because while our scientists on hand know the basics of Gravitronics, our colonization fleet did not bring anyone with an expert level understanding of gravitronics.||All of our key material and energy research rests on our understanding of how the universe actually works. The net benefit is that our ability to research technologies that other civilizations have equivalents of will take less time because they are making use of trial and error in their experiments where-as we are approaching our technological achievements through a more thorough understanding of the universe.|</Details>

			<Details>By making use of an unstable energy source, the weapons on our ships now gain a 10% boost to their damage.  The only downside, if it can be called such, is that the lifespan of those on board will be shortened and it causes increasing pain over time to those who work the weapons. However, we have staffed the most dangerous parts of the ship with lowly abductees from other worlds.</Details>

			<Details>The Hyperion Fabricator is a key technology that we brought to this time. It is what makes much of our unique technologies possible.||For obvious reasons, the fabricator remains incredibly secret.  However, as has become apparent, our powerful technologies are expensive to manufacture and maintain. As a result, we are reliant on third-party contractors more so than other civilizations.||To this end, we have found a way to provide a secure version of the Hyperion Fabrication technique to key third-party contractors. In exchange, we have received a significant discount in the cost to purchase things immediately.</Details>
